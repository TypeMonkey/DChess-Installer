# DChess Installer

*A convenient client installer for [DChess](https://github.com/TypeMonkey/DChess)*

## Requirements
Java 1.8 or higher is needed for this installer to work.

## Instructions
1. Download `installer.jar` 
2. In a command line interface, go to the directory you've downloaded `installer.jar`
3. Type `jar -jar installer.jar <INSTALL_DIR>` in the command line where `<INSTALL_DIR>` is the directory you'd like to install the DChess Client in
4. A bunch of installation messages will be printed out.
5. Once the installation is done, go to your installation folder, then go to the `dchess` folder inside
6. Click the file `DChess.exe` to start the DChess client. (if you're not on Windows, `.exe` should be the equivalent executable file extension)

## Dependencies and Credits
This installer would not be possible without [packr](https://github.com/libgdx/packr) - a library that allows Java developers to package their own JVM with their programs for ease of deployment.
